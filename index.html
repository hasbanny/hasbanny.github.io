        <h2 class="titles" align="center">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p align="justify">I am a recent graduate from <a href="http://www.utrgv.edu/en-us/">The University
        of Texas - Rio Grande Valley</a>,
          where I was part of several important projects. My most recent project involved integrating
          a kinase-substrate prediction method into an R-package and an R-Shiny web application in
          order to make it more accessible to the medical community. This project earned us the 1st
          place at my university's annual senior research competition. These type of projects have
          increased my sense of teamwork, and has improved my self-learning skills. I am currently
          learning Python, as well as increasing my knowledge on R. I also have experience in
          developing different data structures and algorithms in C++. I have experience in web
          development with HTML, PHP, CSS, bootstrap, and Ruby. Aside from my technical experience,
          I have work several jobs in the restaurant industry, which have taught me responsability,
          and has refined my customer service skills. With these experiences, I consider myself a
          well-rounded person, ready to take on a new challenge to keep on growing.
